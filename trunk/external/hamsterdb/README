1. About

hamsterdb is a database engine written in C/C++. It is fast, production-proven
and easy to use.

This release fixes several bugs and improved the whole recovery process.

Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 is no longer supported. Instead, project
files for Visual Studio 2013 were added.

There were various performance improvements.

The custom typdef for hamsterdb types (ham_u32_t, ham_u64_t etc) are deprecated.
They got replaced by types from stdint.h.

A new parameter HAM_PARAM_FILE_SIZE_LIMIT was added; it can set a file size
limit to the Environment (on disk or in memory).

The file format of 2.1.9 is not compatible to 2.1.8.

2. Changes

New Features
* Added new parameter to set a file size limit - HAM_PARAM_FILE_SIZE_LIMIT

Bugfixes
* Fixed a failing test from the erlang package
* Fixed an assert when re-organizing nodes with variable length keys 
* issue #39: recovery can fail with IO_ERROR if journal file is incomplete;
	fixed (thanks, Michael Moellney)
* issue #38: temporary transactions and recovery (w/o transactions)
	created huge logfiles; fixed (thanks, Michael Moellney)
* issue #34: some names violated reserved identifiers, fixed (thanks,
	Markus Elfring)
* Bugfix: fixed-length records were sometimes not inserted correctly 
	with HAM_DUPLICATE_INSERT_FIRST
* Fixed segfault when opening a file with HAM_ENABLE_RECOVERY (and
	without HAM_ENABLE_TRANSACTIONS)

Other Changes
* Removed outdated project files of MSVC2008, added MSVC2013
* Removed custom ham_* typedefs; now using types from stdint.h
* Major rewrite of the recovery logic; increased test coverage
* Added new parameter HAM_PARAM_JOURNAL_SWITCH_THRESHOLD to control
	the size of the journal files
* Unused pages are now freed with madvice; performance improvements
	when large files are mmapped
* Improved record storage and reduced size for fixed length records
* Minor performance improvements for hola_sum
* ABI change: removed deprecated fields from ham_record_t
* Introduced two new makros to initialize ham_key_t and ham_record_t
	structures: ham_make_key, ham_make_record
* The file structure has been completely reorganized. It is described
	in documentation/source/structure.txt.
* Splitting unittests/cursor.cpp in two files to avoid out-of-memory
	errors during compilation on weak VM's
* hamserver now also compiles against libuv 0.10.25 (in addition to 0.11.*)

5. Known Issues/Bugs

None.

6. Compiling

6.1 Linux, MacOS and other Unix systems

To compile hamsterdb, run ./configure, make, make install.

Run `./configure --help' for more options (i.e. static/dynamic library,
build with debugging symbols etc).

6.2 Microsoft Visual Studio 8

A Solution file is provided for Microsoft Visual C++ 2005:
'win32/hamsterdb.sln'. It compiles a static and a dynamic library.
Please read the README.TXT file in the win32 directory.
All libraries can be downloaded precompiled from the hamsterdb webpage.

To download Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition for free, go to
http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/visualc/default.aspx.

6.3 Dependencies

On Ubuntu, the following packages are required:
  - libdb-dev (optional)
  - protobuf-compiler
  - libprotobuf-dev
  - libgoogle-perftools-dev
  - libboost-system-dev
  - libboost-thread-dev
  - libboost-dev
  - (libuv needs to be installed from sources - see
      https://github.com/joyent/libuv)

For Windows, precompiled dependencies are available here:
https://github.com/cruppstahl/hamsterdb-alien

7. Testing and Example Code

Make automatically compiles several example programs in the directory
'samples'. To see hamsterdb in action, just run 'samples/db1'
or any other sample. (or 'win32/out/samples/db1/db1.exe' on Windows platforms).

8. API Documentation

The header files in 'include/ham' have extensive comments. Also, a doxygen
script is available; run 'make doc' to start doxygen. The generated
documentation is also available on the hamsterdb web page.

9. Other Ways to Compile hamsterdb

If you want to compile hamsterdb without using the provided ./configure
environment, you have to set some preprocessor macros:

DEBUG                   enable debugging output and diagnostic checks (slow!)
HAM_32BIT               compile for 32bit (alias: WIN32)
HAM_64BIT               compile for 64bit (alias: WIN64, also needs WIN32)

Also, if you compile for windows, you have to compile the file
'src/os_win32.cc' and ignore the file 'src/os_posix.cc'. Vice versa on
non-Windows platforms.

10. Porting hamsterdb

Porting hamsterdb shouldn't be too difficult. All operating
system dependend functions are declared in 'src/os.h' and defined
in 'src/os_win32.cc' or 'src/os_posix.cc'.
Other compiler- and OS-specific macros are in 'include/ham/types.h'.
Most likely, these are the only files which have to be touched. Also see item
9) for important macros.

11. Migrating files from older versions

Usually, hamsterdb releases are backwards compatible. There are some exceptions,
though. In this case tools are provided to migrate the database. First, export
your existing database with ham_export linked against the old version.
(ham_export links statically and will NOT be confused if your system has a
newer version of hamsterdb installed). Then use the newest version of
ham_import to import the data into a new database. You can find ham_export
and ham_import in the "tools" subdirectory.

    Example (ham_export of 2.1.2 was renamed to ham_export-2.1.2 to document
        that it's an older version):

    ham_export-2.1.2 input.db | ham_import --stdin output.db

12. Licensing

hamsterdb is released under the APL 2.0 license, which allows
unrestricted use for commercial and non-commercial applications. See the
file COPYING for more information.

A commercial, closed source version hamsterdb pro with additional functionality
is available on request. See http://hamsterdb.com for more information.
