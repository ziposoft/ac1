<p>How You Can Help</p>
<ul>
<li>The most important thing you can do is to make sure you are registered to vote. If you are not already registered to vote, click here. To check your registration status, contact your local Board of Elections office at the link above.</li>
<li>Write and call your Representative(s) and Senator and share your concern about animal issues. Most importantly, please ask your Senator/Representative to do all he or she can to make sure the current Bills are passed this session. Find out who represents you using the <a href="http://www.ncleg.net/homePage.pl">N.C. General Assembly website</a> and send your own Representative a personal, handwritten letter . Be sure to include your full name and street address w/ 9-digit ZIP code (which can be found on your driver license or voter registration card). Tell your Senator/Representative why you are personally concerned about passing these Bills.</li>
</ul>
<p>** Remember to be polite and courteous when writing or talking to legislators or their staff. Be sure to tell them that you are either registered to vote or plan to register before the next election. If you know any other pertinent information that might influence your representative, be sure to include it. Please follow up with a phone call to your representative’s home or office.</p>
<p>** Note: If you call the Senator/Representative’s office, you will likely get a secretary. Tell him or her to pass your message onto the Legislator. You do not have to speak to the Senator/Representative personally if you do not wish to talk to them.</p>
<p>** <a href="http://ncvaw.org/blog/about/contact-us/">Email us</a> if you would like a copy of a sample letter. Please include your full name and county of residence in your email.</p>
