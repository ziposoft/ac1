<h1>Lobbying 101</h1>
<p>How to Prepare for a Successful Office Visit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gather a group of dog and cat owners and make an appointment, if necessary. Fridays are best because that is when legislators are usually in their offices.</li>
<li> You may only be able to meet with a staff member but remember that legislators rely heavily on their staff and they can influence how a legislator votes. It is very, very important to educate staff about the issue. Be very cordial to staff members as they are a direct line to the legislator.</li>
<li>If you do meet with staff in the local District office, ask for the name of a staff member in the Capitol office that will be working on the bill. Mail copies of any letters and information to that staff member and follow up with a phone call to make sure your support/opposition is recorded in that office as well.</li>
<li>At the beginning of the meeting identify that you are representing NCVAW and/or various counties. Be prepared to provide some info about NCVAW and it’s members and/or counties represented, etc.</li>
<li>Dress professionally.</li>
<li>Bring copies of the Talking Points and personally hand deliver any letters from&nbsp; any constituents. It is important that they have materials that they can pass on to the legislator.</li>
<li>Always be polite and respectful of the Senator, House Representative or staff member’s time. Plan for 10-15 minutes of discussion but you may only get 5 minutes.</li>
<li>Ask them to support/oppose the bill.</li>
<li>Don’t forget to thank them for their time.</li>
</ul>
