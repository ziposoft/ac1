<br />
The elections cycle is upon us! The NC Primary elections have begun with
the roll out of some strong new candidates in both Senate and House. The
Primaries will narrow down the players to single candidates for the
November elections in each party. There are some considerations NCVAW
would like animal advocates to keep in mind throughout the process.
</p>

	<p>The first is that there are both republicans and democrats that
		support responsible care for animals. Open your mind to the candidate,
		not the party. Talk to your legislators and the candidates about the
		issues that are most important to you and then select who you will
		support. Consider registering UNAFFILIATED so that you can participate
		in the primary of your choice in your district.</p>
	<p>
		You can do that here: <a

	</p>
	<p>Secondly, there are elections that you may want to watch that
		are not in your district. In a recent rant to constituents Senator
		Rabon, District 8 (Brunswick, Pender, Bladen, New Hanover Counties)
		gave us all a brief lesson on politics. He said:</p>
	<p>
		<em>&#8220;Get it loud and you get it clear! It takes 26
			Senators, it takes 61 Representatives, to pass anything, and then the
			Governor has to sign. It takes one jerk to stop it. Start figuring
			those odds.&#8221;<br />
		</em><br /> This was actually an accurate statement. Here is why: Senator
		Rabon is a veterinarian. Not all senators know much about companion
		animals and/or dog breeding, and they relied him on for information about
		HB 930 to provide standards for commercial dog breeders. This is very
		common as our legislators see hundreds of bills each session. They
		turn to their peers that are experts on the subject matter presented
		in the bills. Senator Rabon has passed on information to his fellow
		senators that was not all that accurate. After all of the hard work
		that the House put into drafting this bill and getting it passed with
		overwhelming support, Senator Rabon spent his time putting a stop to
		it.
	</p>
	<p>Senator Rabon said that the bill would do nothing for dogs. HB
		930 actually provides sanitary conditions, safe housing, veterinary
		care, and parasite prevention among other things. At this time, none
		of these standards apply, and that is why NC has so many unscrupulous
		breeders (puppy mills).</p>
	<p>He also falsely claimed that the bill had no appropriations, no
		funds to enforce. The fact is that enforcement would be at county
		level with Animal Control and law enforcement. The standards would be
		added to the NC cruelty statutes, which are already enforced by these
		local agencies. The only difference is that there would be standards
		they could actually apply rather than repeat visits that achieve
		nothing.</p>
	<p>Senator Rabon also said that the bill could apply to livestock
		and impact agriculture. The bill specifically applies to dogs and
		commercial dog breeding facilities that sell to the general public.
		The bill was created by House Representatives and legal staff at the
		legislature and written carefully with our already overburdened Animal
		Control Officers in mind.</p>
	<p>His position on the bill was incredibly confusing. He was quoted
		in the Greensboro News and Record as saying that we did not need any
		new laws to protect dogs because our current laws were sufficient and
		just needed to be enforced. Shortly after, he did a complete
		turnaround and said that HB 930 needed to be stronger. Even more
		confusing, he said that he wanted it to apply to all animals and
		eliminate gas chambers. Of course this new and improved bill would
		only come AFTER the election cycle in 2014.</p>
	<p>Back to Senator Rabon’s quote, “it takes one jerk to kill the
		bill”. He is correct. His peers relied on him for information, and it
		appears that he deliberately misinformed them. Stakeholders tried
		repeatedly to meet with Senator Rabon to explain the rationale behind
		the bill, but he refused to meet on the subject. You should be
		interested in his district because he clearly did have influence over
		a bill that was supported by the majority of North Carolinians.</p>
	<p>Lastly, you can make a difference in any district. You can
		volunteer for a candidate’s campaign, contribute money directly to
		them, or contribute to NCVAW knowing that we are supporting
		legislators that support responsible care for animals.</p>

		Senator Rabon has another veterinarian running against him, Dr. Ernie
		Ward. If you want to see where he stands, you can visit his page. If
		you feel inclined, contribute to his campaign. Go here: <a

		You have the power to create change, and sometimes the greatest change
		for animals may not be directly in your community. Keep an eye on the
		NCVAW Facebook page and website as we highlight candidates and bring
		you information throughout this exciting election year.
