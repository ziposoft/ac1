<td>North Carolina Voters for Animal Welfare is a state-wide political action committee (PAC) dedicated to improving the care and treatment of all animals by electing legislators that will pass laws to<em> </em>protect animals.North Carolina Voters for Animal Welfare (NCVAW) has advocated since 2004 for pro-animal policies. In order to pass strong laws that protect North Carolina’s animals, it is critical to engage in the electoral process as a non-partisan organization. As animal issues are non-partisan, so is NCVAW.
<br/>
North Carolina Voters for Animal Welfare plays an active role in the political process by lobbying to elect legislative candidates, who like you, want a humane state.  The most important decisions made about animals are made by our elected officials at the state and local level. Our goal is to elect a pro-animal majority to the North Carolina Legislature and other state offices.
<br/>
All funds that NCVAW contributes to a legislator's campaign come directly from the funds given to our PAC - from individuals just like yourself. <a href="http://ncvaw.org/donate/">Please donate today.</a></td>
